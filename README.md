### Problem Statement

The Indian insurance landscape grapples with claim processing delays, fraudulent submissions, and opaque practices. Policyholders face unclear coverage details, while insurers lose crores due to falsified documents and inflated claims. InsureSaathi.ai automates validation and settlement, ensuring precision and transparency.

### Insurance Domains Covered

#### 1. Vehicle Insurance

A robust pipeline for document authenticity and damage assessment:

- **Vehicle Identity Verification**
    - **Tech**: YOLOv8 + OCR extracts vehicle make and registration from images.
    - **Validation**: Cross-checks with insurance policy docs and VAHAN API (RC, make, model, owner).
- **Damage Analysis**
    - **Model**: Custom-trained EfficientNetV2-M (ICLR 2021) evaluates panel-level damage, dent types, and severity.
    - **Metrics**: 97%+ accuracy, 98-99% specificity across 40 damage classes.
- **Color Consistency Check**
    - **Method**: Extracts hex color codes via image processing, applies K-Means clustering to detect repainting.
- **Garage Estimate Validation**
    - **Process**: OCR extracts itemized costs, verifies metadata (date, signature, GST), and benchmarks against regional pricing.

#### 2. Health Insurance

Automated triage with regulatory compliance and medical intelligence:

- **Policy Document Verification**
    - **Task**: Extracts UIN, issuer, policy dates; validates against IRDAI product list.
- **Hospital Bill Verification**
    - **Tech**: OCR processes invoices, cross-checks against government-approved price ceilings, flags overcharges.
- **Medical Imaging Analysis**
    - **Model**: EfficientNetV2 + Grad-CAM verifies diagnostic images, detects synthetic alterations.
    - **Metrics**: 98-99% validation accuracy.

#### 3. Life Insurance

Focus on document compliance and death claim verification:

- **Policy Verification**
    - **Task**: Validates UIN, coverage, term, and issuer against IRDAI registry.
- **Death Certificate Verification**
    - **Tech**: OCR extracts name, date, place; cross-matches with hospital records.
    - **Enhancement**: NLP detects inconsistencies.
